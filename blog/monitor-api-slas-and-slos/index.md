# How to Define and Monitor API Service Level Agreements (SLAs) and Objectives (SLOs)

![API SLAs and SLOs](./api-slas-and-slos_png.png)

## Introduction

[APIs](https://monoscope.tech/blog/best-api-monitoring-and-observability-tools/) are the building blocks of modern digital applications and services. They enable communication and data exchange between different systems and platforms. However, APIs also come with certain expectations and requirements from both the providers and the consumers. How can we ensure that the [APIs](https://monoscope.tech/blog/api-log-explorer/) we use or offer are reliable, secure, and efficient? How can we measure and improve their performance and quality? This is where service level agreements (SLAs) and objectives (SLOs) come in handy.

SLAs and SLOs are two key concepts in [API management](https://monoscope.tech/blog/api-downtime/) that help define and monitor the expected level of service for an API. They provide a common language and framework for setting and evaluating the goals and standards of an API.

## Understanding API Service Level Agreements (SLAs)

A service level agreement (SLA) is a formal contract between an API provider and an API consumer that specifies the terms and conditions of the service. It defines the scope, quality, availability, reliability, and performance of the API, as well as the responsibilities and obligations of both parties. An SLA also outlines the consequences of failing to meet the agreed-upon level of service, such as penalties, refunds, or termination of the contract.

SLAs are crucial for API providers and consumers because they establish trust and accountability between them. They also help avoid misunderstandings and disputes by clarifying the expectations and requirements of each side. Moreover, SLAs can help improve customer satisfaction and retention by ensuring that the API meets or exceeds their needs and expectations.

Some common SLA metrics for APIs are:

- **Response time**: The amount of time it takes for an API to return a response to a request. It measures the speed and efficiency of the API.
- **Availability**: The percentage of time that an API is operational and accessible. It measures the uptime and reliability of the API.
- **Error rates**: The percentage of requests that result in errors or failures. It measures the quality and stability of the API.

## Defining Clear Objectives with Service Level Objectives (SLOs)

A service level objective (SLO) is a specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound goal that an API provider sets for their service. It describes the desired level of performance or quality for an API based on one or more metrics. Unlike SLAs, SLOs are not contractual obligations but rather internal targets that help guide the development, testing, deployment, and maintenance of an API.

SLOs contribute to a better understanding of system performance by providing quantifiable indicators of how well an [API](https://monoscope.tech/blog/api-log-explorer/) is meeting its SLAs. They also help identify areas of improvement or optimization for an API by highlighting gaps or issues in its performance or quality. Furthermore, SLOs can help align the priorities and incentives of different teams or stakeholders involved in delivering or consuming an API by setting common goals and standards.

## Setting Smart SLO Goals

To set SMART SLOs, we have to consider the following aspects:

- **Specificity**: We need to define SLO objectives clearly and unambiguously, using precise terms and numbers. For example, instead of saying "the API should be fast", we can say "the average response time of the API should be less than 500 milliseconds".
- **Measuring**: We need to choose appropriate metrics that can accurately capture and reflect the SLO objectives. For example, if we want to measure availability, we can use metrics such as uptime percentage or downtime duration.
- **Achievability**: We need to ensure that SLO objectives are realistic and attainable, given the resources, constraints, and trade-offs involved in delivering or consuming an API. For example, we cannot expect an API to have 100% availability if it depends on external factors or services that are beyond our control.
- **Relevance**: We need to ensure that SLO objectives are aligned with the needs and expectations of both the API providers and consumers. For example, we should not set SLO objectives that are too high or too low for the value or importance of the API.
- **Time-bound**: We need to specify a time frame or deadline for achieving or evaluating the SLO objectives. For example, we can set SLO objectives for a day, a week, a month, a quarter, or a year.

## The Role of Stakeholder Communication

Communication is a vital element in any successful SLA/SLO strategy. It involves collaboration between [API](https://monoscope.tech/blog/web-api-performance/) providers and consumers to establish clear expectations, requirements, feedback mechanisms, and escalation procedures for SLAs/SLOs. It also involves regular reviews and discussions to align expectations, monitor progress, resolve issues, celebrate achievements, and identify opportunities for improvement.

Stakeholder communication is important because it helps build trust and transparency between API providers and consumers. It also helps avoid or minimize conflicts or misunderstandings by ensuring that both parties are on the same page regarding the SLAs/SLOs. Moreover, stakeholder communication can help foster a culture of continuous improvement and innovation by encouraging feedback, learning, and adaptation.

Some of the best practices for stakeholder communication are:

- Establishing clear communication channels for SLAs/SLOs, such as email, phone, chat, or dashboard.
- Documenting and sharing the SLAs/SLOs, as well as the roles and responsibilities of each party, in a clear and accessible way.
- Providing timely and accurate updates and reports on the status and performance of the SLAs/SLOs, using relevant metrics and visualizations.
- Soliciting and responding to feedback and suggestions from both parties on how to improve or optimize the SLAs/SLOs.
- Conducting periodic reviews and meetings to evaluate the SLAs/SLOs, identify gaps or issues, celebrate successes, and plan for future actions.

Google is one of the pioneers of using SLAs and SLOs for its internal and external [APIs](https://monoscope.tech/blog/web-api-performance/). Google defines SLAs as the minimum level of service that it guarantees to its customers, while SLOs are the target level of service that it strives to achieve internally. Google uses a variety of tools and methods to monitor its SLAs and SLOs, such as dashboards, alerts, error budgets, and postmortems. Google also publishes its SLAs and SLOs publicly for some of its APIs, such as Google Cloud Platform, Gmail, YouTube, and Maps. This way, Google demonstrates its commitment to transparency and accountability, as well as builds trust and loyalty with its customers.

## Tools and Technologies for SLA and SLO Monitoring

API monitoring is the process of collecting, analyzing, and displaying data on the performance and quality of an [API](https://monoscope.tech/blog/web-api-performance/). It helps API providers and consumers track and measure the SLAs/SLOs, as well as detect and troubleshoot any problems or anomalies that may affect them. Monitoring is essential for ensuring that the API meets or exceeds the expectations and requirements of both parties.

There are many tools and technologies available for monitoring SLAs/SLOs for APIs. Some of the factors to consider when choosing the right monitoring tool for your API are:

- The type and scope of the metrics you want to monitor, such as response time, availability, error rates, throughput, latency, etc.
- The frequency and granularity of the data collection and analysis, such as real-time, near-real-time, or batch.
- The format and presentation of the data visualization and reporting, such as graphs, charts, tables, dashboards, alerts, notifications, etc.
- The integration and compatibility with other tools or platforms that you use or depend on for your API, such as development environments, testing frameworks, deployment pipelines, cloud services, etc.
- The cost and complexity of the tool installation, configuration, maintenance, and support.

Some examples of popular monitoring tools for APIs are:

- [APIToolkit](https://monoscope.tech): A comprehensive tool for designing, testing, documenting, and [monitoring](https://monoscope.tech/blog/api-error-monitoring/) APIs. It allows you to create requests, run tests, generate reports, set up alerts, etc.
- Prometheus: An open-source tool for monitoring and alerting systems. It collects metrics from various sources using a pull model. It also provides a powerful query language and visualization features.
- Grafana: An open-source tool for data visualization and analysis. It connects to various data sources and allows you to create dashboards with graphs, charts, tables, etc. It also supports alerting and notification features.
- New Relic: A cloud-based platform for observability and analytics. It monitors various aspects of your system performance, such as infrastructure, applications, [APIs](https://monoscope.tech/blog/api-logs/), etc. It also provides insights and recommendations for optimization and improvement.

## Best Practices for Continuous Improvement

One of the key benefits of SLAs and SLOs is that they provide a framework for continuous improvement, allowing API providers and consumers to identify and address issues, [optimize performance](https://monoscope.tech/blog/metrics-that-matter/), and deliver better user experiences. Here are some best practices on how to use SLAs and SLOs for continuous improvement:

### The concept of "Error Budgets" and its role in SLO management

An error budget is a concept that defines how much error or downtime an API can tolerate within a given time period, based on its SLOs. For example, if an API has an availability SLO of 99.9%, it means that it can be unavailable for up to 0.1% of the time, or about 43 minutes per month. This is the error budget for the API.

The error budget can be used as a tool for managing trade-offs between reliability and innovation. For example, if an API has consumed most of its error budget in a month, it may be wise to postpone any risky changes or deployments until the next month, to avoid breaching the SLO. On the other hand, if an API has a lot of unused error budget, it may indicate that the SLO is too conservative, and that the API can afford to experiment with new features or optimizations, without compromising user satisfaction.

### Analyzing historical data to identify areas for improvement

Another best practice for continuous improvement is to analyze historical data on SLAs and SLOs, to identify patterns, trends, and anomalies that may indicate areas for improvement. For example, by looking at historical data on response time, throughput, error rate, and availability, an API provider can pinpoint the root causes of performance issues, such as bottlenecks, bugs, or misconfigurations. Similarly, by looking at historical data on user feedback, satisfaction, retention, and churn, an API consumer can assess the impact of SLAs and SLOs on user behavior and loyalty.

By analyzing historical data on SLAs and SLOs, both [API](https://monoscope.tech/blog/mastering-api-debugging/) providers and consumers can gain insights into how to improve their APIs, such as by optimizing code, scaling resources, fixing errors, enhancing security, or adding new features.

### Making data-driven decisions to enhance API reliability

The third best practice for continuous improvement is to make data-driven decisions based on SLAs and SLOs, to enhance API reliability. For example, by [monitoring](https://monoscope.tech/blog/understanding-the-distinction/) SLAs and SLOs in real-time or near real-time, an API provider can detect and resolve issues before they affect users or breach the SLA. Similarly, by tracking SLAs and SLOs over time or across different environments or regions, an API consumer can compare and evaluate different API providers or alternatives based on their performance and quality.

By making data-driven decisions based on SLAs and SLOs, both API providers and consumers can ensure that they are delivering or receiving the best possible service from their APIs.

## Conclusion

API service level agreements (SLAs) and objectives (SLOs) are powerful tools for defining and monitoring the quality and performance of your APIs. Effectively using them can help you can align your API goals with your user needs and business outcomes. You can also leverage SLAs and SLOs to improve your API reliability, scalability, security, compliance, usability, functionality, innovation.

# Outgoing Integrations Page

In this guide, you will learn how to effectively navigate through the **Outgoing Integrations** page on the monoscope dashboard and maximize all the powerful features accessible in it.

```=html
<hr />
```

On this page, you will find all the outgoing requests from your API. Like the other pages, you can **search** for specific requests or **sort** based on the first/last time the request was detected or the number of events associated with the request.

  <p>An <b>outgoing request</b> is the API request your make from your server to another (e.g., a request to an external API inside your own API). monoscope will also return outgoing requests in association with the incoming request that triggered them.</p>

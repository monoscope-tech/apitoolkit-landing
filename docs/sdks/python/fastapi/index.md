# FastAPI SDK Guide

In this guide, you’ll learn how to integrate OpenTelemetry into your FastAPI application and install the Monoscope SDK to enhance its functionalities. By combining OpenTelemetry’s robust tracing and metrics capabilities with the Monoscope SDK, you’ll be able to monitor incoming and outgoing requests, report errors, and gain deeper insights into your application’s performance. This setup provides comprehensive observability, helping you track requests and troubleshoot issues effectively.

```

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have already completed the first three steps of the [onboarding guide](/docs/onboarding/){target="\_blank"}.

## Installation

Kindly run the command below to install the monoscope fastapi sdk and necessary opentelemetry packages:

```sh
pip install monoscope-fastapi opentelemetry-distro opentelemetry-exporter-otlp
opentelemetry-bootstrap -a install
```

## Setup Open Telemetry

Setting up open telemetry allows you to send traces, metrics and logs to the Monoscope platform.
To setup open telemetry, you need to configure the following environment variables:

```sh
export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT="http://otelcol.apitoolkit.io:4317"
export OTEL_SERVICE_NAME="my-service" # Specifies the name of the service.
export OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES="at-project-key={ENTER_YOUR_API_KEY_HERE}" # Adds your API KEY to the resource.
export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL="grpc" #Specifies the protocol to use for the OpenTelemetry exporter.
export OTEL_PYTHON_LOGGING_AUTO_INSTRUMENTATION_ENABLED=true # enable logging auto instrumentation

```

Then run the command below to start your server with opentelemetry instrumented:

```sh
opentelemetry-instrument uvicorn main:app
```

Or run using `gunicorn` with `gunicorn` config

```sh
opentelemetry-instrument gunicorn -c gunicorn.conf.py main:app
```

```=html
<div class="callout">
  <p><i class="fa-regular fa-lightbulb"></i> <b>Tip</b></p>
  <p>The <code>{ENTER_YOUR_API_KEY_HERE}</code> demo string should be replaced with the API key generated from the Monoscope dashboard.</p>
</div>
```

## Monoscope FastAPI Configuration

After setting up open telemetry, you can now configure the monoscope fastapi middleware.

Next, initialize Monoscope in your application's entry point (e.g., `main.py`), like so:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from monoscope_fastapi import Monoscope

app = FastAPI()

# Initialize Monoscope
monoscope = Monoscope()
app.middleware("http")(monoscope.middleware)
# END Initialize Monoscope

@app.get("/")
def read_root():
  return {"Hello": "World"}
```

:::
| Option | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |

| `debug` | Set to `true` to enable debug mode. |
| `tags` | A list of defined tags for your services (used for grouping and filtering data on the dashboard). |
| `service_version` | A defined string version of your application (used for further debugging on the dashboard). |
| `redact_headers` | A list of HTTP header keys to redact. |
| `redact_response_body` | A list of JSONPaths from the request body to redact. |
| `redact_request_body` | A list of JSONPaths from the response body to redact. |
| `capture_request_body` | Set to `true` to capture the request body. |
| `capture_response_body` | Set to `true` to capture the response body. |

## Redacting Sensitive Data

If you have fields that are sensitive and should not be sent to Monoscope servers, you can mark those fields to be redacted (the fields will never leave your servers).

To mark a field for redacting via this SDK, you need to add some additional fields to the `monoscope` configuration object with paths to the fields that should be redacted. There are three variables you can provide to configure what gets redacted, namely:

1. `redact_headers`: A list of HTTP header keys.
2. `redact_response_body`: A list of JSONPaths from the request body.
3. `redact_request_body`: A list of JSONPaths from the response body.

```=html
<hr />
```

JSONPath is a query language used to select and extract data from JSON files. For example, given the following sample user data JSON object:

```json
{
  "user": {
    "name": "John Martha",
    "email": "john.martha@example.com",
    "addresses": [
      {
        "street": "123 Main St",
        "city": "Anytown",
        "state": "CA",
        "zip": "12345"
      },
      {
        "street": "123 Main St",
        "city": "Anytown",
        "state": "CA",
        "zip": "12345"
      }
    ],
    "credit_card": {
      "number": "4111111111111111",
      "expiration": "12/28",
      "cvv": "123"
    }
  }
}
```

Examples of valid JSONPath expressions would be:

{class="docs-table"}
:::
| JSONPath | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `$.user.addresses[*].zip` | In this case, Monoscope will replace the `zip` field in all the objects of the `addresses` list inside the `user` object with the string `[CLIENT_REDACTED]`. |
| `$.user.credit_card` | In this case, Monoscope will replace the entire `credit_card` object inside the `user` object with the string `[CLIENT_REDACTED]`. |
:::

  <p><i class="fa-regular fa-lightbulb"></i> <b>Tip</b></p>

</div>

```

Here's an example of what the configuration would look like with redacted fields:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from monoscope_fastapi import Monoscope

app = FastAPI()

redact_headers = ["content-type", "Authorization", "HOST"]
redact_response_body = ["$.user.email", "$.user.addresses"]
redact_request_body = ["$.users[*].email", "$.users[*].credit_card"]

monoscope = Monoscope(
  redact_headers=redact_headers,
  redact_response_body=redact_response_body,
  redact_request_body=redact_request_body
)

app.middleware("http")(monoscope.middleware)

@app.get("/")
def read_root():
  return {"Hello": "World"}
```

```=html
<div class="callout">
  <p><i class="fa-regular fa-circle-info"></i> <b>Note</b></p>
  <ul>
    <li>The <code>redact_headers</code> variable expects a list of <b>case-insensitive headers as strings</b>.</li>
    <li>The <code>redact_response_body</code> and <code>redact_request_body</code> variables expect a list of <b>JSONPaths as strings</b>.</li>
    <li>The list of items to be redacted will be applied to all endpoint requests and responses on your server.</li>
  </ul>
</div>
```

## Error Reporting

Monoscope automatically detects different unhandled errors, API issues, and anomalies but you can report and track specific errors at different parts of your application. This will help you associate more detail and context from your backend with any failing customer request.

To manually report specific errors at different parts of your application, use the `report_error()` function from the `monoscope_fastapi` module, passing in the `request` and `error`, like so:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, Request
from monoscope_fastapi import Monoscope, report_error

app = FastAPI()

monoscope = Monoscope()
app.middleware("http")(monoscope.middleware)

@app.get('/')
async def sample_route(request: Request):
  try:
    v = 1 / 0
    return {"zero_division": v}
  except Exception as e:
    # Report the error to Monoscope
    report_error(request, e)
    return {"message": "Something went wrong"}
```

## Monitoring Outgoing Requests

Outgoing requests are external API calls you make from your API. By default, Monoscope monitors all requests users make from your application and they will all appear in the [API Log Explorer](/docs/dashboard/dashboard-pages/api-log-explorer/){target="\_blank"} page. However, you can separate outgoing requests from others and explore them in the [Outgoing Integrations](/docs/dashboard/dashboard-pages/outgoing-integrations/){target="\_blank"} page, alongside the incoming request that triggered them.

To monitor outgoing HTTP requests from your application, use the `observe_request()` function from the `monoscope_fastapi` module, passing in the `request` argument, like so:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, Request
from monoscope_fastapi import observe_request

app = FastAPI()

monoscope = Monoscope()
app.middleware("http")(monoscope.middleware)

@app.get('/')
async def sample_route(request: Request):
  resp = observe_request(request).get("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/2")
  return resp.read()
```

The `observe_request()` function accepts a **required `request` argument**, and the following optional arguments:

{class="docs-table"}
:::
| Option | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| `url_wildcard` | The `url_path` string for URLs with path parameters. |
| `redact_headers` | A list of HTTP header keys to redact. |
| `redact_response_body` | A list of JSONPaths from the request body to redact. |
| `redact_request_body` | A list of JSONPaths from the response body to redact. |

<div class="callout">
  <p><i class="fa-regular fa-lightbulb"></i> <b>Tip</b></p>
  <p>The `observe_request()` function wraps an <a href="https://github.com/monoscope-tech/monoscope-fastapi" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">HTTPX</a>
